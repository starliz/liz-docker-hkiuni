# The base image:
FROM ubuntu:latest

# If we add another package in the apt-get install -y line some other day, 
# the sources might have changed and thus the installation will fail. 
# When something depends on another command, itâ€™s best practise to run them together.
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get -y install curl

# Create and set the current working directory to /mydir after this directive
WORKDIR /mydir 

# Adds a file from the same location where Dockerfile is
COPY script.sh .

# This will be executed when using "docker run"
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
CMD ["./script.sh"]
