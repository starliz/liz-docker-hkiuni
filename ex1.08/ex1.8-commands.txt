When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. Bind mounts rely on the host machine’s filesystem having a specific directory structure available.
When you use a volume, a new directory is created within Docker’s storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages that directory’s contents.

 -v creates a directory if the file does not exist.
